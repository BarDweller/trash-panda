Galanthus Managed App

This app is a simple Spring Boot app, that uses the Spring Boot via Snowdrop via the Galanthus parent pom.

This allows the pom.xml for this app to be shorter, and more concise, as the bulk of the declarations are 
made by the Galanthus parent pom. 

This app references the parent pom via JitPack, but it could just as easily come from a private maven repository, or github packages.
